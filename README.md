# Sudoku-C-
This is the first version of the Sudoku game. I've done this after getting stucked while solving one... So do what you know better and **code your way out.** 

![Demo](https://github.com/robertadriang/Sudoku-C-/blob/master/Sudoku.png)

## Rules
- As stated by Wikipedia: *Sudoku is a logic-based combinatorial number-placement puzzle. The objective is to fill a 9x9 grid with digits so that each column, each row and each of the nine 3X3 subgrids that compose the grid contain all of the digits from 1 to 9.*

## How does it work?
+ You can introduce your own Sudoku grid and get your solution.
+ You can generate Sudoku puzzles from scratch.
+ You can check if your Sudoku is indeed a Sudoku (A well-formed Sudoku puzzle is one that has a **unique solution**. Multiple solutions means having to guess not to think logical and that's not funny.)    

### Soon:
+ A real interface (I hope)
+ A better puzzle generator
